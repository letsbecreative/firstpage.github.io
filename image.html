	<dt>C LANGUAGE <img src="OIP.jpg" height="50px" bridth="500px" alt="">  <abbr title="C programming">*</abbr>  </dt>
	    <dd>C programming is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern</dd>

	<dt>C++LANGUAGE<img src="OIP (1).jpg" height="50px" bridth="500px" alt=""> <abbr title="C++ programming">*</abbr>  </dt>
	    <dd>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes. The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.</dd>

	<dt>PYTHON LANGUAGE <img src="OIP (2).jpg" height="50px" bridth="500px" alt=""> <abbr title="Python programming">*</abbr> </dt>
	    <dd>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</dd>
